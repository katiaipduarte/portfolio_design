# Portfolio Design

This is the front-end design for my portfolio website. To style the website I decided to use SCSS and
later compile it to CSS with Koala (see more in http://koala-app.com/). Furthermore, this design is completely
responsive and it should work in all browsers.

In the Portfolio page, we have a masonry layout (similar to the one in Pinterest). The cover images in the same
page, have a overlay quality with the project title and the category to which the project belongs.

Animation appear to not work in Safari browser.
